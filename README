This project is an attempt to modify the open source ArduImu software in order to sense position and rotation information for a homemade Quad Copter built by John McArthur and Paul Rancuret.

Originally, the code was taken from version 1.9.8 of the ArduImu software, for the Ardu-IMU board.  The Wiki for this board (along with downloadable code and other information) is found at https://code.google.com/p/ardu-imu/.

Modifications to make to this software:

Changed Serial.print() commands to Serial.write() under the file Output.pde, in sections meant to print binary data.  This will correctly print binary instead of ASCII data.

Eclipse is used as the IDE for this project, instead of the Arduino IDE.  For this reason, all code is treated as conventional c++ code, and requires the normal header files with function declarations, etc.  These files have been modified to add the necessary prototypes.
